# Overview:
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for **10 million** deaths in **2020**. **(2.21 millon)** cases 
were of lung cancer. Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body.
Other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal
cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other
organs; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Widespread metastases are the primary cause of death from cancer.

Cancer mortality is reduced when cases are detected and treated early.

# Lung_Cancer_Detection
The purpose of this  project is to develop a prediction system that helps people to know their cancer
risk with low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their  cancer
risk status.

# Lung_cancer_detection_using_ML
Here, in this project I used **Random Forest Classifier to detect the lung cancer**.

# Note: How to access this dataset
